Welcome to my website! My name is Ramses, originally from [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona), Spain, and currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.polisci.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. 

My research interests are in political economy and applied statistics. In political economy, I investigate inequality, redistribution, and wage determination in post-industrial societies, with a focus on labor market institutions, industrial relations, and political behavior. I also have broad interests in methodology, including measurement models, machine learning, and panel data/multilevel methods.

Please note that I am currently using this website for [teaching](https://rllob.github.io/teaching/) purposes and it is still underconstruction.
