# Prerequisite

```{r}

# data is simulated, no need to load anything

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate the population data with 1000 observations
population <- runif(1000, min = 0, max = 4)

```


# Simulation of random sampling

In this exercise, we'll randomly sample three distinct sets from the same underlying population. The objective is to compute the means and confidence intervals for each sample, capturing the associated uncertainty.

To start, compute the mean and standard deviation for each sample. Remember:


Sample mean

$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} (X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$

Sample standard deviation


$$S^2 = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}}$$



```{r}
# Calculate the true population mean


# Randomly select 3 sets of 100 observations each
sample1 <- sample(population, size = 100)


# Calculate the sample means
sample1_mean <- mean(sample1)

# Calculate the sample standard deviations
sample1_sd <- sd(sample1)

```


Second, after obtaining the sample mean and standard deviation estimates, let's compute the **standard error** to account for uncertainty.


$$SE(\bar{X}) = \frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{n}}$$



```{r}
# Calculate the standard error of the mean


```


Third, we estimate the margin error and the confidence interval under a particular confidence level.


$$ME = \text{{critical value}} \times SE(\bar{X})$$




```{r}
# Calculate the margin of error for three different critical values

me1 <- 1.645 * se1 # 90% confidence level
me2 <- 1.96 * se2  # 95% confidence level
me3 <- 2.576 * se3 # 99% confidence level

# Calculate the confidence intervals


# Create a data frame for plotting

```


# Visualize your estimations using ggplot. Use the geometric shaoes `geom_pointrange()` and `geom_hline()` to show the confidence intervals and where the true parameter lies.


```{r}
# Plot the distribution of the sub-samples with confidence intervals



```
