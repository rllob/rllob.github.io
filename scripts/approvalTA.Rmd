As the statistics department chair, you need to analyze the approval ratings (`approve`) of a Ph.D. candidate who applied to teach during the summer quarter. The data includes anonymized information on students' `age`, `gender`, and major: economics (`econ`), sociology (`soc`), and political science (`polisci`).


```{r}
# load data
dat <- read.csv(file="data/approvalTA.csv")

names(dat)
```


Run three separate models, each with one predictor. Each model regresses the bald TA's approval ratings against a major predictor: polisci, econ, and soc.

Display the output of each `ml()` object using the summary() function.


```{r}


```


Display the three model's results together using `stargazer()`. Remember to set the code chunk option `results='asis'` when knitting stargazer output in PDF.



```{r,results='asis'}




```


Repeat the analysis with two predictors. For instance, in the first model, regress approvals on `polisci` and `econ`; in the second, on `polisci` and `soc`; and in the third model, on `econ` and `soc`.

Consider using stargazer for easier comparisons. What differences do you observe, and why? How can you interpret these consistent results?

```{r}



```


Again, perhaps stargazer will make the comparisons easier. What do you see? Why are the results changing? How can you interpret these results in a consistent manner?

```{r,results='asis'}




```


Now, estimate the following model:


$$ approval_i = \alpha + \beta_1 age_i + \beta_2 econ_i + \beta_3 female_i + e_i$$



```{r}


```


```{r,results='asis'}


```




Finally, estimate the following model:


$$ approval_i = \alpha + \beta_1 age_i + \beta_2 female_i + \beta_3 (age_i*female_i) + e_i$$

Notice that $\beta_3$ represents an interaction effect. Interactions always require the estimation of the two (or more) variables interacting, including its lower order factors, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$

# Extra: coefficient plot


*Note: This final section is optional and does not need to be submitted for earning participation points in this activity.*


Use the `tidy()` fromt the package `broom` function to extract the regression analysis results and create a coefficient plot, which will effectively communicate the results in a table format.


The function `tidy()` will extract all the estimates and its relevant statistics from a model object.

```{r}
res <- broom::tidy(m3, conf.int = T, conf.level = 0.95)

res <- res %>% mutate_if(is.numeric,round,3) # dplyr code, roundic numeric columns to 3 digits
```


```{r}
# remove the intercept and only keep the point estimates and the confidence intervals

res <- filter(res, term != "(Intercept)")

```


```{r}


# create a coefficient plot with ggplot

ggplot(data=res,
       aes(y= term,
           x = estimate,
           xmin= conf.low,
           xmax= conf.high)) +
  geom_pointrange() +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(estimate, 2)), hjust = -1, vjust = -1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color="red") +
  labs(y = "", 
       x = "Estimated coefficients (95% confidence interval)",
       title = "Dependent variable: TA approvals (Model 3)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
