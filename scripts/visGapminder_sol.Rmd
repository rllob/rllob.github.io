# Review of factors

 - Create a new variable named **poor**, defined as any observation with a `gdpPercap` value below or equal to the 10th percentile (1st decile) of the distribution, assigning the value 1 if it is equal to or below the 10th percentile, and 0 otherwise. 


 - After creating this variable, generate a new one named **poor_f** as a factor version. Set the correct levels and label them as *poor* for 1 and **not poor** for 0.


```{r}

## create variable poor using ifelse() and quantile()


gapminder$poor <- ifelse(gapminder$gdpPercap <= quantile(gapminder$gdpPercap,probs = 0.1),
                         1,0)

## create the factor variable "poor_f"

gapminder$poor_f <- factor(gapminder$poor,
                           levels = c(0,1),
                           labels = c("not poor","poor"))

```

# Density plot by group

Please create the following plots

1. Distribution of `gdpPercap` using either a histogram or density plot. Inside the `geom_` function, define the `fill=` aesthetics with a color of your choice.

2. Group `gdpPercap` distribution per continent defining `group=` and `fill=` in the general aesthetics `aes()`

3. Repeat the previous plot but now take the logarithm `log()` of `gdpPercap.` Ypu can define this transformation directly within the general `aes()`.

4. Repeat the previous plot (3.) but now split each continent in multiple facets using `facet_wrap()`.


```{r}

# 1.

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_density(fill="steelblue1")

# 2.

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, 
                      group=continent,
                      fill=continent)) +
  geom_density()


# 3.

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = log(gdpPercap), 
                      group=continent,
                      fill=continent)) +
  geom_density()


# 4.

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = log(gdpPercap), 
                      group=continent,
                      fill=continent)) +
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~ continent)


```



# Boxplot by group using `fill`

Please plot the following box plots

1. Distribution of `lifeExp` for each continent 

2. Distribution of `lifeExp` for each continent by poor status. Note that you do not need to define the `group` in the aesthetics because the levels are already defined in the `x` aesthetic.



```{r}
# 1.

ggplot(gapminder, aes(y = lifeExp, 
                      x = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# 2.

ggplot(gapminder, aes(y = lifeExp, 
                      x = continent,
                      fill=poor_f)) +
  geom_boxplot() 


```




# Create a visual of your choice


Generate a novel plot with the gapminder dataset, avoiding duplication of any previously created plots. Feel free to employ different aesthetics or geometries, such as `geom_line` or `geom_point`, ensuring the plot is informative. If applicable, incorporate colors for enhanced visualization.


```{r}
