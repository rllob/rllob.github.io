We will be using data from the European Social Survey, specifically from wave 5 in 2010. The dataset, unions_sweden.csv, includes information on socioeconomic characteristics for over 1,289 respondents from Sweden. Our focus is on labor unions, and we will be utilizing the following variables:

 -------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
 Name                             Description
 -------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
 `Country`                         Name of the respondent's country of residence.
 
 `union`                           Whether the respondent is an active member of a labor union (`0`= No, `1`= Yes)
 
 `gndr`                           Respondent's gender (`0` = male, `1`= female)
 
 `income`                         Respondent's disposable income.
 
 `sector`                         Sector in which the respondent is employed. It follows the Industry, NACE classification.
 
 `lrscale`                        Placement on left right scale (where `0` = left, `1`= right)
 
 `gincdif`                        Respondent's answer to question "Government should reduce differences in income levels" (where `5` = Agree strongly, `4` = Agree, `3` = Neither agree nor disagree, `2` = Disagree, `1` = Disagree strongly)

# Section 1

## Union's treatment effects

Estimate the differences between the control and treatment groups based on the "union" variable for the outcomes `income` and `gincdif.` Report these estimates. Do these estimates **identify** the causal effects of the "union" variable? Check the balance between the control and treatment groups.


```{r}

## check balance between treatment and control


## estimate union effect on income




## estimate union effect on gincdif.


```


## Confounding

Since this sample has been adjusted to achieve a nearly equal number of non-union (**control**) and union membership (**treatment**) respondents, we would anticipate an approximate 50% proportion of union members across various observable factors if, and only if, the **assumption of covariate balance** holds. This balance serves as a tentative assumption of the causal effects of union membership, conditioned on other factors. 

To assess this assumption, let's examine the proportion of union members at each level of the left-right ideological scale (`lrscale`). Does the data corroborate this assumption?

```{r}

## Look at the proportion of union memberhsip with tapply


## new function: aggregate


```

Additionally, consider identifying another variable that may confound union membership.

```{r}

## check balance of union membersip based on gender



## check proportion of union membership conditional on sector


```


# Section 2

## Adjusting confounding

Use the `lm()` function to regress the outcomes `income` and `gincdif` on the treatment variable union using a linear model. Save the output in an object and use the `summary()` function to examine the estimated coefficients. Compare these coefficients with the previously calculated differences for the union variable.

```{r, results='asis'}



```

Repeat the same exercise, but this time include the variables `lrscale` and `sector`. How much have change your estimations after **adjusting for confounding**? Can we say that we have identified a causal estimate?


```{r, results='asis'}


```


Are there differences in redistributive attitudes between male and female union members? Compare the `gincdif` variable between the two groups.

```{r}


```

Also, examine union-gender differences by sector and save your visualizations to your local folder. Are these differences considered **causal effects**?

```{r}


```
