## Introduction

Let's revisit several functions or concepts we've learnt from lectures and QSS tutorials that help you succeed in finishing Problem Set 1. We'll cover: 

* `tapply()`

* `quantile()`

* `ifelse()` or `case_when`

* class `factor`  


## Load the gapminder data again

```{r}
# load data

data <- read.csv("data/gapminder.csv")

```

## `tapply` for group means

Using the `tapply` function, please find:

1. The average `gdpPercap` for each `continent`

2. The average `gdpPercap` for each `year`

3. The average `gdpPercap` for each `continent` over every `year`

```{r}

# 1.

tapply(data$gdpPercap, data$continent, mean)

# 2.

tapply(data$gdpPercap, data$year, mean)

# 3. in here you will need to use list()

tapply(data$gdpPercap, list(data$year, 
                            data$continent), mean)


```

## quantile and ifelse

Using `quantile` and `ifelse` function, please create:

1. An object `gdp_qt` that records the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile of `gdpPercap` variable

2. A new variable `poverty` that takes the value of 1 if `gdpPercap` is lower than or equal to the lower quartile; 0 otherwise. What is the `sum` of countries in poverty? And their proportion?

3. A new variable `gdpPercap_cat` that converts `gdpPercap` into four categories: `poor`, `middle`, `wealthy`, and `very wealthy` based on quartiles in `gdp_qt`

4. Use `tapply` to find the mean of `lifeExp` for each income group, based on `gdpPercap_cat`

```{r}
# 1.
gdp_qt <- quantile(data$gdpPercap)

gdp_qt


# 2.
data$poverty <- ifelse(data$gdpPercap <= gdp_qt[2], 1, 0)

table(data$poverty)

sum(data$poverty)

mean(data$poverty)

# 3. 

# 4.



```

## Factor

How to inform `R` that `gdpPercap_cat` has an inherent order? 

1. Check out the class of `gdpPercap_cat`

2. Use `factor()` to convert `gdpPercap_cat` into factor, and specify the `levels = c(...)` argument. In the levels argument you will concatenate the four categories `poor`, `middle`, `wealthy`, and `very wealthy` in this order.

3. Check out the class of `gdpPercap_cat` again

4. Use `tapply` to find the mean and standard deviation of `lifeExp` for each income group, based on `gdpPercap_cat`

```{r}
# look at the class of gdpPercap_cat

# Turn it into a factor with ordered levels

# Look at the conditional mean of life expectancy by income group

# Look at the conditional standard deviation of life expectancy by income group


```



## Intro to ggplot

Using `ggplot`, create two visualizations:

  - A scatter plot between life expectancy (`lifeExp`) and income (`gdpPercap_cat`).
  - A boxplot between life expectancy (`lifeExp`) and the categorical variable of income (`gdpPercap_cat`).

What do you observe in terms of associations and dispersion of the distributions? Remember that you will need to load either the library of `ggplot2` or `tidyverse`.

```{r}

# create a scatter plot


# create a boxplot


```
