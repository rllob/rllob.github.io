We will be using data from the European Social Survey, specifically from wave 5 in 2010. The dataset, unions_sweden.csv, includes information on socioeconomic characteristics for over 1,289 respondents from Sweden. Our focus is on labor unions, and we will be utilizing the following variables:

 -------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
 Name                             Description
 -------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
 `Country`                         Name of the respondent's country of residence.
 
 `union`                           Whether the respondent is an active member of a labor union (`0`= No, `1`= Yes)
 
 `gndr`                           Respondent's gender (`0` = male, `1`= female)
 
 `income`                         Respondent's disposable income.
 
 `sector`                         Sector in which the respondent is employed. It follows the Industry, NACE classification.
 
 `lrscale`                        Placement on left right scale (where `0` = left, `1`= right)
 
 `gincdif`                        Respondent's answer to question "Government should reduce differences in income levels" (where `5` = Agree strongly, `4` = Agree, `3` = Neither agree nor disagree, `2` = Disagree, `1` = Disagree strongly)
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

# Union's treatment effects

Estimate the differences between the control and treatment groups based on the "union" variable for the outcomes `income` and `gincdif.` Report these estimates. Do these estimates **identify** the causal effects of the "union" variable? Check the balance between the control and treatment groups.


```{r}

## check balance between treatment and control

table(unions$union_f)


## estimate union effect on income

mean(unions$income[unions$union_f=="treatment"]) - mean(unions$income[unions$union_f=="control"])



## estimate union effect on gincdif.

mean(unions$gincdif[unions$union_f=="treatment"]) - mean(unions$gincdif[unions$union_f=="control"])

```


# Confounding

Since this sample has been adjusted to achieve a nearly equal number of non-union (**control**) and union membership (**treatment**) respondents, we would anticipate an approximate 50% proportion of union members across various observable factors if, and only if, the **assumption of covariate balance** holds. This balance serves as a tentative assumption of the causal effects of union membership, conditioned on other factors. 

To assess this assumption, let's examine the proportion of union members at each level of the left-right ideological scale (`lrscale`). Does the data corroborate this assumption?

```{r}

## Look at the proportion of union memberhsip with tapply

tapply(unions$union, unions$lrscale, mean)

## new function: aggregate

aggregate(union ~ lrscale, data = unions, FUN= mean)

```

Additionally, consider identifying another variable that may confound union membership.

```{r}

## check balance of union membersip based on gender

mean(unions$gndr[unions$union_f=="treatment"]) - mean(unions$gndr[unions$union_f=="control"])


## check proportion of union membership conditional on sector

aggregate(union ~ sector, data = unions, FUN= mean)

```


# Adjusting confounding

Use the `lm()` function to regress the outcomes `income` and `gincdif` on the treatment variable union using a linear model. Save the output in an object and use the `summary()` function to examine the estimated coefficients. Compare these coefficients with the previously calculated differences for the union variable.

```{r, results='asis'}

m1 <- lm(income ~ union, data = unions)
m2 <- lm(gincdif ~ union, data = unions)

library(stargazer)

stargazer(m1,m2,
          type="latex")    # change to type="text" to display the results in the console


```

Repeat the same exercise, but this time include the variables `lrscale` and `sector`. How much have change your estimations after **adjusting for confounding**? Can we say that we have identified a causal estimate?


```{r, results='asis'}

m3 <- lm(income ~ sector + lrscale + union, data = unions)
m4 <- lm(gincdif ~ sector + lrscale + union, data = unions)


stargazer(m3,m4,
          omit = "sector", # for space concern, omit reporting sector coefficients.
          type="latex")    # change to type="text" to display the results in the console


```


Are there differences in redistributive attitudes between male and female union members? Compare the `gincdif` variable between the two groups.

```{r}

# group_by with dplyr

unions %>% 
  group_by(union_f,gndr_f) %>% 
  summarize(gincdif=mean(gincdif,na.rm=T)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = c("union_f","gndr_f"),
              values_from = gincdif) %>% 
  mutate(gndr_diff=treatment_Female-treatment_Male)

# with base R

women_union <- mean(unions$gincdif[unions$union_gndr=="trt_female"])
men_union <- mean(unions$gincdif[unions$union_gndr=="trt_male"])
women_union - men_union


```

Also, examine union-gender differences by sector and save your visualizations to your local folder. Are these differences considered **causal effects**?

```{r}


unions %>% 
  # group by categories
  group_by(sector,union_f,gndr_f) %>% 
  # estimate the summaries of interest
  summarize(ginunions=mean(gincdif,na.rm=T)) %>%
  # pivot from long to wide
  pivot_wider(id_cols = "sector",
              names_from = c("union_f","gndr_f"), # note the two groups
              values_from = "ginunions") %>% 
  mutate(diff=treatment_Female-treatment_Male,
         diff = round(diff,2))

# save the data in an object for visualization  

vis <-
  unions %>% 
  group_by(sector,union_f,gndr_f) %>% 
  summarize(ginunions=mean(gincdif,na.rm=T)) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = "sector",
              names_from = c("union_f","gndr_f"),
              values_from = "ginunions") %>% 
  mutate(diff=treatment_Female-treatment_Male,
         diff = round(diff,2))

vis %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=diff,
             y=(sector=reorder(sector, diff)))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0,linetype="dashed") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y="sector",
       x="Gender-union treatment differences",
       title="Unionized gender effects on solidarity by sector")


# width = 6
# ggsave("output/gndr_diff.punions", width = width, height = width/1.618)


```
