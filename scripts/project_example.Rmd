# Data cleaning and preliminaries (not be included in your submissions)


First, ensure to clean and prepare your data for analysis. Remember **not to include this section** in your final project submission. Treat your final project as if it were a report for a consulting firm or a submission to a scientific journal. Therefore, avoid displaying code or unnecessary computations. Instead, focus on presenting figures, tables, and statistics that are essential for addressing your research question, conducting analysis, and drawing conclusions. Additionally, **refrain from displaying any code**. Only present well-formatted figures, tables, and results. Ensure that your general chunk options include the argument `echo = FALSE`.


I will grade your assignments based on:

- **Well-written content** (proofread), including research questions, hypotheses, analysis, interpretation, discussions, and conclusions, with accurate interpretations. Misinterpreting results or statistical tests will affect your final grade.

- Adherence to the structure outlined in this template, following the delineated sections:
  - Introduction
  - Theory and hypotheses
  - Data and visual analysis
  - Statistical analysis
  - Conclusions
  

- Presentation of **formatted figures and tables** with informative labels and rounded numbers. I understand the challenges of positioning tables or figures and will be forgiving in this regard, as fixing their placement in your PDF output can be challenging for RMarkdown beginners. I will provide code and tips in this template.

Below, I've addressed the cleaning of this project. The code chunk has the option `include=FALSE` to **prevent** the output from this data cleaning part being displayed in the final printed PDF version. **You must not show how you clean your data.** However, in the *data and methods* section, you must report and explain any significant modifications or transformations of the raw data, such as the percentage of missing data and the extent to which your sample size decreased after cleaning.

Please note that we will be using the `transphobia_all.csv` dataset, which can be found in the application of *Brookman and Kalla's (2016)* paper.

```{r, include=FALSE}

names(dat) # see the data

freq.na(dat) # the relative and absolute NAs for each variable

# select the relevant variables for your project/analysis

dat_c <- dat[,c("therm_trans_t1","treat_ind","age","female",
                "voted_gen_14","voted_gen_12","racename","democrat")]

# Look at the class of your data

str(dat_c)

# first, let's turn "racename" categorical variable into a factor


dat_c$racename <- factor(dat_c$racename,
                         levels = c("Caucasian",
                                    "African American",
                                    "Hispanic",
                                    "Asian",
                                    "Native American"))

# notice that by setting "Caucasian" as the first level
# Therefore, it becomes the baseline comparison in a regression analysis

# check out the frequencies of each non-ordered category

table(dat_c$racename)

# Notice that Asian and Native American have very low frequencies

# to avoid artifacts or small sample bias, I will remove these categories
# alternatively, you could merge them into a category called "others"

# two different ways:

# 1. create an object with the categories that we want to retain

races <- c("Caucasian","African American","Hispanic")

# 2. create an object with the categories that we DO NOT want to retain

racesNO <- c("Asian","Native American")

# Use filter from dyplr

dat_c <- filter(dat_c, racename %in% races) # filter categories in "races" object

dat_c <- filter(dat_c, !racename %in% racesNO) # filter categories NOT in "racesNO" object

# Either way provides the same result.
# Notice that because we used "filter" from dplyr, the output object "dat_c" becomes a tibble.

# Notice that we removed the observations, but the categories are still in the variable.

table(dat_c$racename)

# We can use the function droplevels() to remove categorical levels without observations

# First, remove NAs to retrieve complete cases.

dat_c <- na.omit(dat_c)

# Now, drop levels of empty categories

dat_c <- droplevels(dat_c)

table(dat_c$racename) # no more empty categories, the variable is clean.

# Finally, for visualization purposes, let's create factor variables of the dummy indicators.

# note: do not substitute the original values, instead just create new ones but with class factor.

# factor for female

dat_c$female_f <- factor(dat_c$female,
                         levels=0:1,
                         labels=c("male","female"))


dat_c$democrat_f <- factor(dat_c$democrat,
                           levels=c(0,1),
                           labels=c("republican","democrat"))



dat_c$treat_ind_f <- factor(dat_c$treat_ind,
                            levels=c(0,1),
                            labels=c("control","treatment"))



dat_c$voted_gen_14_f <- factor(dat_c$voted_gen_14,
                               levels=c(0,1),
                               labels=c("NoVoted","Voted"))



dat_c$voted_gen_12_f <- factor(dat_c$voted_gen_12,
                               levels=c(0,1),
                               labels=c("NoVoted","Voted"))


# Finally, the outcome variable is coded as higher levels, more tolerance, and less prejudice.


# If we want to frame the analysis in terms of prejudice, it would be interesting to inverse the coding, such that lower levels of the outcome variable will represent less prejudice.


# Therefore, in this final part, I am going to invert the scale of the dependent variable.

summary(dat_c$therm_trans_t1) # check out distribution

dat_c$prejudice_trans <- (dat_c$therm_trans_t1 - 100)*(-1)


# The above calculation does not change the variance, it only reverse the ordering of the scale such that those an observaiton that was ranking 97, in the inverted scale now ranks 3. 


# I made this transformation only because I want to frame my research and analyses in terms of prejudice.

summary(dat_c$prejudice_trans) # check out new inverted scale distribution



# review that everything make sense. Look at the summaries and data class structure

summary(dat_c)

str(dat_c)

## we have concluded the data cleaning.


```


## A note on formatting tables and using stargazer()


In your final project, ensure you present formatted tables. I recommend using the `stargazer()` function, but you can also explore other options like `KableExtra` or `pander`.

When using `stargazer()`, consider these arguments and chunk options to enhance presentation:

  - Set `header=FALSE` to eliminate a redundant message from the function author.
  - Adjust `column.sep.width = "1pt"` to reduce column separation width.
  - Utilize the `title` argument to name the table.
  - Specify `digits = 2` or your preferred number to limit displayed decimals.
  - Choose `type = text` for console printing and `type = latex` for PDF output in \LaTeX.
  Remember to set the code chunk option `results='asis'` for proper rendering.

If a `stargazer` table in the PDF **floats** away from its code **position**, it is acceptable. Don't worry excessively about table placement. If a table becomes overly wide, consider splitting it into two. Focus on reporting important variables and results, and avoid tables with no significant information.

You can see how I have programmed the below tables in the original `project_example.Rmd`.


# Introduction


This is the first section, it introduces your project topic and its significance. It outlines **why the topic is important** and what insights it can offer. Ideally, you should present it as a puzzle, and your analysis is going to contribute to one piece to "solve" this puzzle. Additionally, you should briefly outline your research question, units of analysis, and other contextual factors such as the year of the data and the number of countries, regions, or respondents involved. This section should be concise, spanning no more than 2 or 3 paragraphs.



# Theory and hypotheses


This section begins by revisiting the **research question**: *"Why do people hold prejudices towards other groups or communities?"* and *"What factors can contribute to the reduction of outgroup prejudice?"* Research questions often start with **"Why"** or **"What"** and may be follwed by narrower question that explore the same relationship.

After introducing the research question, , a brief literature review should be included, summarizing previous research and theories related to the project topic. This review helps in narrowing the analysis, selecting statistical controls, and possibly adding additional hypotheses. No particular citation format is prefered.

Towards the end of this section, narrow hypotheses should be provided, addressing a causal relationship of interest ($X \rightarrow Y$) based on the research question. It's crucial to explain the underlying causal mechanism ($\rightarrow$) between the predictor $X$ and the outcome $Y$.

In this project, the causal assumption/mechanism ($\rightarrow$) is that *communication* and *information* ($X$) can influence beliefs and prejudices towards an outgroup ($Y$). This psychological mechanism suggests that outgroup prejudice stems from limited empathy and interaction with specific minorities and their struggles. Thus, providing accurate and credible information about these minorities should bridge the gap between subjective and objective knowledge, resulting in reduced outgroup prejudice. In other words, we expect a **negative relationship** between providing more sensible information about outgroups and outrgroup prejudice.

Based on this causal assumption, two hypotheses are considered:

- $H_0$: **Conversations** promoting the active adoption of others' perspectives do not reduce prejudice. ($\beta_{treatment} = 0$)

- $H_1$: **Conversations** promoting the active adoption of others' perspectives reduce prejudice. ($\beta_{treatment} < 0$)

Typically, the null hypothesis $H_0$ is implicit in the alternative $H_1$. However, for clarity, both are stated here.


# Data and visual analysis

## Data

In this section, report your data collection and research design. 

Begin reporting your sample size and rellevant data cleaning procedures. Discuss whether the design is **experimental** or **observational**, detailing treatment assignment and potential confounding. Report any variable transformations made. For instance, I inverted the scale of `therm_trans_t1` to create `prejudice_trans`, to reflect a negative association with treatment, as hypothesized in $H_1$. 

After detailing each variable and data, provide well-formatted tables with descriptive statistics, such as a correlation matrix and measures of centrality and dispersion. I will use the `stargazer()` function to present formatted tables, but you can use any other functions.


```{r, results='asis'}

# REMEMBER: when using stargazer(), include the option "results='asis'" in your code chunk. See the options of this code chunk.


# Display descriptive statistics table

# first select only numerical/quantiative variables

dat_des <- dat_c[,c("prejudice_trans","treat_ind","age","female",
                    "democrat","voted_gen_12")]

# Display well-formatted table using stargazer

stargazer(as.data.frame(dat_des), # input the object "as.data.frame" for descriptives
          summary.stat = c("mean","sd","min","median","max"),
          type="latex",
          header = FALSE,
          title = "Descriptive statistics",
          digits = 2)
```


```{r, results='asis'}

# Display a correlation matrix

# create an object with the correlation matrix

dat_cor <- cor(dat_des)

# Now we need to format the correlation matrix, start rounding the digits

dat_cor <- round(dat_cor, digits = 2)

# display the correlation matrix in a formmatted table using stargazer

stargazer(dat_cor, 
          type="latex",
          title = "Correlation matrix",
          column.sep.width = "1pt",
          header = FALSE, 
          digits = 2)

# REMEMBER: when using stargazer(), include the option "results='asis'" in your code chunk. See the otpions of this code chunk.

```


Present the correlation coefficients and analyze them. In this instance, the treatment variable `treat_ind` exhibits a negative correlation of -0.12 with the outcome `prejudice_trans`. Additionally, `age` demonstrates a positive correlation of 0.17 with prejudice, while `female` displays a negative correlation of -0.13. The positive correlation between `age` and `prejudice_trans` might indicate cohort effects, suggesting that older respondents are more likely to harbor prejudices toward the trans community.


## Exploratory data analysis

In this section, conduct a **visual analysis** of the variables of interest. Begin by ploting correlations among the main variables of interest, followed by exploring the data structure and relationships using visuals. 

Choose the most **meaningful visuals** to include in your final project and refine them accordingly. Additionally, in your final projects, **provide a narrative** explaining your selection of specific visuals and how they inform your model selection to test your hypotheses.


```{r,fig.width=6,fig.height=4,fig.align='center'}
# let's make some visuals with ggplot.


# start looking at the distribution of prejudice between treatment and control

ggplot(data=dat_c,
       aes(y=prejudice_trans,
           x=treat_ind_f,
           fill=treat_ind_f)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()

## The distribution of prejudice is too skewed resulting in the  median and the third quarterly coinciding in the same point.
```

The above is an example of a **bad visualizaiton**, which you **should not report**!

The provided boxplot illustrates a **skewed distribution** of prejudice, which compromises its visual effectiveness. The skewed distribution results in the **median** and the **third** quartile aligning, obscuring the box's appearance. However, the plot offers valuable insight: the distribution between the median and the first quartile is wider in the treatment group compared to the control group. This suggests that more respondents from the treatment group are dispersed across the lower half of the distribution, indicating lower levels of prejudice. You can transmit the same insight by simply reporting a **differences in means** of prejudice between the treatment and control group.


We saw that **age** is positively correlated with prejudice. We can look at the distribution of age as a function of the respondent's race.


```{r,fig.width=6,fig.height=4,fig.align='center'}
## Something interesting is that the treatment group 


ggplot(data=dat_c,
       aes(y=age,
           x=racename,
           fill=racename)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x="",y="Age") +
  theme_minimal()

```


The boxplot indicates that the median age of Caucasian respondents is higher compared to African American and Hispanic individuals. Given the importance of age as a control variable and the likely correlation between race and outgroup prejudice, we should include the "race" factor in the statistical analysis to account for its influence on the treatment's marginal effect.


We can now explore linear relationships between age and prejudice, conditioning on the treatment group to see whether treatment effects hold controlling for age.

```{r,fig.width=6,fig.height=4,fig.align='center'}
# if we call the function geom_smooth without specifying the argument "method",
# it will use as a default a "loess" fit. A loess function is flexible and may
# be useful to explore the structural form of the data. For example, if there
# are non-linear relationships, like a quadratic relation


# conditioning with the treatment, we see two parallel trends

ggplot(data=dat_c,
         aes(y=prejudice_trans,
             x=age,
             color=treat_ind_f)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  labs(x="Age",y="Prejudice towards Trans Community") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(20,70)) + # ylim, limits the displayed Y axis
  theme_minimal()
```



Age correlates positively with prejudice. However, upon considering treatment status, we observe a lower initial level of prejudice in the treatment group compared to the control. This difference implies that, on average, respondents receiving the treatment exhibit lower prejudice levels, even after accounting for age.

To delve deeper, we'll introduce another factor: race. Specifically, we'll focus on differences between Caucasian and Hispanic respondents in adjusted prejudice levels by age.


```{r,fig.width=6,fig.height=4,fig.align='center'}

# Subset data with only Caucasians and Hispanic by removing African Americans

dat_race <- filter(dat_c, racename != "African American")

# Visualize differneces by comparing small multiples based on race


ggplot(data=dat_race,
         aes(y=prejudice_trans,
             x=age,
             color=treat_ind_f)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              formula = "y~x",
              se=FALSE,
              alpha=0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~racename) +
  labs(x="Age",y="Prejudice towards Trans Community") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(20,75)) + # ylim, limits the displayed Y axis
  theme_minimal()

```


For simplicity, I removed the confidence intervals by setting the argument `se=FALSE` in `geom_smoth()`. Moreover, I used `facet_wrap()` as a function of `racename` to split the visual in two subplots, one doing the regression for the Caucasian sample and the other for Hispanics.



# Statistical analysis


After completing the exploratory data analysis and conducting preliminary regressions, we will select the **model specification** with the relevant predictors, including necessary controls. In your liner models, you shoudl only inlude interactions of interest, the main predictor/treatment, and only controlling for confounders $Z$. That is, variables that follow this relationship $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$.

Recall:


- $H_0$: Conversation encouraging the active adoption of others' perspectives **does not** reduce prejudice. ($\beta_{treatment} = 0$)

- $H_1$: Conversation encouraging the active adoption of others' perspectives reduces prejudice. ($\beta_{treatment} < 0$)


## Linear regression analysis

Our strategy will involve presenting the model **progressively**, beginning with a bivariate regression between the independent and dependent variables. We will then gradually incorporate relevant controls until we present the full specification. We aim to limit the number of models to a maximum of four.

The results presentation should consistently provide evidence directly related to our **hypothesis** and assess whether this evidence **substantially changes** with the inclusion of controls.


Again, I will be using `stargazer()` function to report the estimated models in table. 




```{r,results='asis'}

m1 <- lm(prejudice_trans ~ treat_ind, data = dat_c)
m2 <- lm(prejudice_trans ~ treat_ind + age, data = dat_c)
m3 <- lm(prejudice_trans ~ treat_ind + age + female + racename, data = dat_c)
m4 <- lm(prejudice_trans ~ treat_ind + age + female + racename + democrat + voted_gen_14, data = dat_c)


stargazer(m1,m2,m3,m4,
          type="latex",
          style = "ajps",
          column.sep.width = "1pt",
          title = "Regression analysis of treatment on prejudice",
          header = FALSE,
          omit.stat=c("f", "ser"))

```


## Results discussion

After the analysis, you should discuss the following:


- Does the evidence support rejecting the **null hypothesis** ($H_0$) in favor of the **alternative hypothesis** ($H_1$)?

- Is this evidence **consistent** across different model specifications and **significance levels**?

- What **future research** suggestions can enhance our understanding of these findings and further investigate the research question in your project?




# Conclusion


In the conclusion, succinctly summarize the analysis conducted in 2 or 3 paragraphs. Reflect on your original research question and hypotheses, detailing the data and research design employed. Evaluate the results obtained from your analysis and assess whether they align with your initial hypotheses. Importantly, **refrain from introducing new information**; instead, offer a concise recapitulation of the preceding sections and reported results.
