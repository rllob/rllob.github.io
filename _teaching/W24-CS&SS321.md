This post comprises my teaching assistant materials for the quiz sections of an undergraduate introductory course in data science with R/RStudio, instructed by Professor [Caitlin Ainsley](https://www.caitlinainsley.com/). See my [teaching assistant syllabus](https://rllob.github.io/files/CSSS321_WI24_TA_Syllabus.pdf) for the sections contents and policy.



Overview
======

The section contents are divided into modules dedicated to "best practices" in R programming, theory review, data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analyses in R, consolidating techniques learned in lectures and QSS tutorials while introducing new skills relevant to the course contents. All lab materials can be found in this page, including Zoom recordings of each lab section.

I will offer office hours by appointment in [Zoom](https://washington.zoom.us/j/3542421158). Please note that it *may* take me up to 24 hours to respond to a student's email, so it is a good idea to plan ahead and email me in advance. When you email me, please include (1) the topic you would like to discuss and (2) your time availability for scheduling a meeting.


Slack channel
======

Students can join the course Slack workspace in [the following link](https://join.slack.com/t/uw-csss321-w24-acad/shared_invite/zt-2a1h6cy5i-UWyjRCfzUEIczJJvVC3M7A).

A portion of the student's final grade depends on section participation, which I will monitor through Slack. Slack, designed for team communication, collaboration, and project management, organizes communication into channels, facilitating real-time messaging. Slack is the most preferred communication channel, which allows users to insert code block in their messages. It has the added benefit of facilitating knowledge spillover through peer discussion and mutual assistance.

In some quiz sections, we will use Slack for sharing R code answers and collaborative problem-solving during in-section data analysis exercises. Participation is also considered when addressing questions or bug errors shared in Slack, either by you or your peers (see more in the [syllabus](https://rllob.github.io/files/CSSS321_WI24_TA_Syllabus.pdf)).


Module's contents
======

Find below the materials necessary for each module's quiz section.

Module 1 - Getting started with `R`/`R`Studio.
------
[Module's slides](https://rllob.github.io/files/module1_intro.pdf).

This module offers an overview of basic R functions and introduces the R-Studio interface. It covers installing R/RStudio and relevant packages, creating R projects, managing working directories, introducing R Markdown, and creating and sharing minimal, reproducible examples for programming assistance via Slack. 

To run the QSS tutorials, install all necessary packages and dependencies found in the *installing_packages.R* script file. In [here](https://washington.zoom.us/rec/share/B4revCvyR2p_9THnz1VKnp9mb35xwMuAEs48vbs3GNyA0OhjjT-xgg2tLj_60K5f.V3jIi_NH981s2vrI) you can access a short recording on ***how to run QSS tutorials*** in RStudio.

- R scripts/RMarkdown files

    - [RMarkdown_sample.Rmd](https://github.com/rllob/rllob.github.io/blob/master/scripts/RMarkdown_sample.Rmd)

- Datasets 
    - [voted.csv](https://rllob.github.io/datasets/voted.csv).
    - [turnout.csv](https://rllob.github.io/datasets/turnout.csv).
    - [voted_na.csv](https://rllob.github.io/datasets/voted_na.csv).


Module 2 - Data management and exploratory visual analysis.
------
[Module's slides](https://rllob.github.io/files/module2_EDA.pdf).

This module equips students with essential computing skills for data science to successfully complete course assignments and their final projects. Some of the topics include creating and manipualting data frames, logical tests, subsetting, NA data, pivoting and merging datasets, and visualization with base R and ggplot2.
