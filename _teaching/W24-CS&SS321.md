This post comprises my teaching assistant materials for the quiz sections of an undergraduate introductory course in data science with R/RStudio, instructed by Professor [Caitlin Ainsley](https://www.caitlinainsley.com/). See the [teaching assistant syllabus](https://rllob.github.io/files/CSSS321_WI24_TA_Syllabus.pdf) for the quiz section's policy.



Overview
======

The section contents are divided into modules dedicated to "best practices" in \texttt{R} programming, theory review, data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analyses in \texttt{R}, consolidating techniques learned in lectures and QSS tutorials while introducing new skills relevant to the course contents. All lab materials can be found in my \href{https://rllob.github.io/teaching/W24-CS&SS321}{course website}, including Zoom recordings of each lab section.

I will offer office hours by appointment in \href{https://washington.zoom.us/j/3542421158}{Zoom}. Please note that it \emph{may} take me up to 24 hours to respond to a student's email, so it is a good idea to plan ahead and email me in advance. When you email me, please include (1) the topic you would like to discuss and (2) your time availability for scheduling a meeting.


Slack channel
======
A portion of the student's final grade depends on section participation, which I will monitor through Slack. Slack, designed for team communication, collaboration, and project management, organizes communication into channels, facilitating real-time messaging.

In some quiz sections, we will use Slack will for sharing \texttt{R} code answers and collaborative problem-solving during in-section data analysis exercises. Participation is also considered when addressing questions or bug errors shared in Slack, either by you or your peers (see more in the [syllabus](https://rllob.github.io/files/CSSS321_WI24_TA_Syllabus.pdf)).

Students can join the course Slack workspace in [the following link](https://join.slack.com/t/uw-csss321-w24-acad/shared_invite/zt-2a1h6cy5i-UWyjRCfzUEIczJJvVC3M7A).


Module 1 - Getting started with `R`/`R`Studio.
======
[Module's presentation slides](https://rllob.github.io/files/module1_intro.pdf).

This module provides an overview of the sections and logistics. How to install R/RStudio and rellevant packages, how to create R projects and manage working directories, introduction to R Markdown, and how to create and share minimal, reproducible examples for programming assistance through Slack.
